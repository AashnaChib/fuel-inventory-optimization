# Fuel Inventory Optimization and Cost Efficiency

This project analyzes **1.85M+ rows of fuel inventory data** to identify purchasing inefficiencies and recommend cost-saving strategies.  

## Overview
- **Goal:** Reduce stockouts and holding costs while maintaining service levels.  
- **Data:** Fuel levels, tank IDs, invoices, and location records.  
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, missingno)  
- **Methods:** Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, inventory cost analysis  

## Key Results
- Processed 5 datasets with over 1.85M records  
- Evaluated fuel usage patterns and tank levels  
- Identified inefficiencies in purchasing and holding costs  
- Proposed optimized ordering strategies for cost efficiency
